Bibliophile Book Club is a book club for adults based in Roscam, Co. Galway. The book club meet in the Cumasu Center twice a week on a Tuesday morning and evening at 10am and 7pm.
Members can bring along tea, coffee and treats to the morning club and wine if they wish to the evening meet-up.

The Bibliophile Book Club website is set up to provide information to people wishing to join a group such as meeting times, what to bring and location. It also provides them with a means to join the bookclub on the join us page. New members can choose whether they want to join the morning or evening group.

For existing members, the site provides information on what the club are currently reading and links to where they can read reviews and purchase books.
