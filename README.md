### **5. Surface**  
Once the content for the website was chosen, I began to look at the design and aesthetics of the site.
## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  
In order to create a very inclusive book club website, I incorporated yellows, browns, and oranges into the surface plane design to evoke warmth, accessibility, and diversity

Yellow: Yellow symbolizes energy, happiness, and optimism. It will be utilised as an accent color to draw attention to important elements on the website, such as navigations and calls to action.

Brown: Brown signifies stability, reliability, and earthiness. It will serve as the primary background color for the website, providing a sense of grounding and comfort. 
  
Orange: Orange represents creativity, enthusiasm, and encouragement. It will be incorporated into the design through highlights, borders, or decorative elements to add vibrancy and excitement.

### **Typography**  
  
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the fonts 'Dosis' and 'Madimi One' defaulting to sans -serif. I like the fun, retro element of Madimi One for the logo and button text. Dosis was chosen to have a consistent, ligible font fot the rest of the body text.

### **Imagery**  

Images and icons were taken from and/or created in Canva and are all royalty free. I chose an inviting image for the hero image of people of all ages to highlight the diversity of the book club.
